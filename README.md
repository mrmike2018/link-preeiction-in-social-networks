# link-preeiction-in-social-networks
This is a project for predicting future links in a social network.
I used different topological and aggregated futures to train different machine learning methods which are then used for predicting future links in a social network.

The corresponding article/report is avilable at arXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16327.pdf

More details about this project will be provided soon.
